## 🌱 About Me
Hi there! I'm Sareeya 👋 — a Computer Science major at UC Davis with a focus on full-stack engineering, cloud systems, and applied machine learning.  

I love building things that *work in the real world* — whether that’s  
🚅 IoT transit systems,  
🧠 ML-powered tools,  
🌐 full-stack web apps, or  
☁️ internal infrastructure for actual organizations.

When I’m not studying or shipping code, you’ll find me debugging something at 2 AM, organizing tech communities, or teaching beginners how to code. 💻
